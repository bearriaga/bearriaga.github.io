                    <ul class="collapse show" id="spellList">
                        <li>I like to play D&D, my current character is a Wizard, and during a delve in the Dungeon of the Mad Mage, he has managed to amass a dozen different spellbooks. The rulebook stated the following: <i>“To determine a particular spellbook’s contents, roll a d6. The book contains four wizard spells of each level up to and including the number rolled on the die. For example, on a roll of 3, a spellbook contains four spells of each level from 1st through 3rd. Pick spells from the wizard spell list.”</i></li>
                        <li>After rolling a six sided die for each spellbook I saw that I needed to select a total of 160 different spells, this would take too long to manually so I decided to write an application that would select spells at random. The application would generate a unique list of spells for each level of spells the book contained, and then do this for each book, ultimately creating a string for each spell level one through six. The final list of spells would be condensed to only contain unique spells.</li>
                        <li>Broke down the steps that needed to take place to generate the spells based on the numbers initially rolled.</li>
                        <li>Wrote a jQuery call to be made in the console of a chrome window with the spells listed on the DnDBeyond website, in order to obtain a string containing all of the spells that exist for a Wizard.</li>
                        <li>Created a Console Application and wrote out the logic in C#.</li>

                        <li>The organization I was working for had a need to validate the roles that every employee had yearly, this was done by the manager of each employee.
